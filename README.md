# Boris_Bike

Boris Bike is based on the public transport system in London of renting a bike from a docking station which are placed around London and then returning the bike to a station after use.
The bikes are used by users but are controlled by tfl and can be transported between docking stations and to the hanger for fixing by a van. 
Each docking station can take a maximum of 20 bikes, users can report broken bikes and bikes will only be released for use if they are working.

This version of Boris Bikes is written in Ruby and tested using rspec.

To install:

  - Clone the repo
  - Install rspec using 'bundle install rspec' from the command line
  - To see tests run rspec
